SEOUL: The Day of the Sun — the April 15 holiday celebrating Kim Jong Un 's late grandfather, Kim Il Sung — has long been the most important date on North Korea's political calendar. This year, the supreme leader failed to show.Kim Jong Un's absence from an event he has often used to signal strength at home and abroad sparked a global search for explanations. Two weeks later, the whereabouts of the 36-year-old leader has become one of the world's great mysteries, fed by internet rumors, satellite photos and anonymously sourced reports.Here's some possible scenarios being discussed:The first credible report that something was wrong with Kim was also among the least alarming. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based news outlet that gathers information from people inside North Korea, reported April 20 that Kim underwent a ""cardiovascular surgical procedure"" the previous week and was now mostly recovered.The report, attributed to a single unidentified person, did offer several specific details, including that Kim was treated at the Hyangsan Medical Center on the outskirts of Pyongyang. While no governments have verified the report, South Korean officials later said that Kim was believed to be conducting ""normal activities"" in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides, actions that could be consistent with the recovery explanation.""Kim Jong Un is alive and well,"" Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to South Korea's president, told Fox News on Sunday. Moon, however, added that Kim had been staying in the coastal resort area of Wonsan since April 13, something that would clash with the Daily NK account.Hours after the Daily NK article, CNN provided a more worrying assessment of Kim's health, reporting that the US was monitoring intelligence that suggested he was in ""grave danger"" after surgery. Bloomberg News separately reported that US officials were told that Kim was in critical condition, but were unsure of his current status.While US President Donald Trump said Thursday that he believed the CNN report was ""incorrect"" and based on ""old documents,"" rumors about Kim's deteriorating condition only accelerated on social media. On Saturday, Reuters reported that the Chinese Communist Party's International Department dispatched a team including medical experts to North Korea on Thursday to advise on Kim. The news service, which cited three people familiar with the situation, said it was unclear what the delegation signaled about Kim's health.China's foreign ministry, which is separate from the International Department, said only that it had sent reagents for coronavirus testing to North Korea. ""That is not the same as a medical team,"" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Monday in Beijing.On Monday, Trump said at a White House news conference that he knew Kim's condition, but ""can't talk about it right now."" The president added that ""nobody knows"" were Kim is.The Chinese medical team could also point to what's now a more common health concern: Covid-19 . Although North Korea has disclosed no infections, the country has quarantined thousands of people and the US's top general in South Korea has said he was ""fairly certain"" the country has cases. China has been sending experts around the world to help combat the pandemic that began on its soil.The Seoul-based JoongAng Daily newspaper reported Monday that the North Korean leader was in self-quarantine. The paper, citing an unidentified person in China, said that Kim was monitoring his health after one of his bodyguards was confirmed with the coronavirus infection. That's why China sent some 50 medical staff to North Korea, the newspaper said.Days before Kim failed to show up for holiday events, his Workers' Party of Korea issued social-distancing orders on April 11 requiring members to refrain from gatherings of more than three people, the Hankook Ilbo newspaper reported Tuesday. The report, which was attributed to an unidentified person familiar with the matter, said Kim may have missed the events to avoid the disease.The search for Kim has repeatedly led back to eastern tourist enclave of Wonsan, the site of a palatial family compound and frequent missile tests. Satellite photos analyzed by the website 38 North showed that a train resembling the armored one used by North Korea's leaders was parked at the local railway station last week.The eastern coastal area saw a burst of military activity, including cruise missile tests and fighter jet maneuvers, on April 14 — the day before Kim failed to show up for Day of the Sun events about 230 kilometers (140 miles) to the west in Pyongyang. Ri Jong Ho, a high-profile North Korean defector who now lives in the US, told the Seoul-based DongA Daily newspaper that Kim may have been injured in the exercises.Still, it would be unusual for North Korean military officials to allow their top leader to get close enough to the action to get hurt. Also, the satellite photos don't confirm the train's presence in the area until April 21. Images from April 15 show no train.Some such as Yoon Sang-hyun, a South Korean lawmaker who heads a committee on inter-Korean relations, have wondered whether Kim devised the disappearance as a way to draw attention to the regime. Yoon speculated that the North Korean leader would have to show up in public in the next couple of weeks to avoid a destabilizing debate about his grip on power and potential successors.""If he doesn't, it's a real big issue,"" Yoon told reporters Monday, according to the DongA Daily. ""Kim is apparently not running the country as he would normally do now.""There's also a good chance the world may never get a satisfying explanation. Kim similarly vanished from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or was even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane. No reason for his absence has ever been given.","Order NowSEOUL: The Day of the Sun — the April 15 holiday celebrating Kim Jong Un 's late grandfather, Kim Il Sung — has long been the most important date on North Korea's political calendar.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/older-and-stuck-at-home-expert-advice-on-fitness/articleshow/75421446.cms,Older and stuck at home? Expert advice on fitness,"When we asked readers what they want to know about exercise and the coronavirus , many of you wrote that you were concerned about how to exercise and maintain fitness if you or someone you love is older or has functional limitations, such as arthritis or joint replacements. Experts who study exercise and aging had a lot to say.Among their suggestions: Soup-can dumbbells and indoor gardening might help older people who are new to working out to weather the physical effects of a prolonged coronavirus lockdown. Access to a stairwell also is a boon, they say, but even a hallway can be a route to sustained fitness.Past science suggests that any health impacts from prolonged home confinement are likely to be greatest among older people. In multiple studies, when adults of any age become more inactive because of illness, injury or requests from scientists, they rapidly lose strength and endurance and develop early signs of insulin resistance and molecular changes related to muscle loss. In younger people, such physiological weakening typically reverses as soon as they start moving and exercising normally again. But in older people, the effects can linger and accelerate the onset of frailty.Some experts have begun to worry that this scenario is playing out among older people during the coronavirus stay-at-home orders. “I think we’re seeing a slow-motion version of the kind of declines that usually occur when older people are hospitalized or bedridden,” says Dr. Louise Aronson, a professor of geriatrics and health at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of “Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life.”Aronson and other exercise scientists offered a variety of recommendations about the types and amounts of activities older people might try to complete in their buildings, homes, living rooms or even chairs during the lockdowns to stave off frailty and maintain their health. The expert responses proved to be uniformly reassuring, boiling down to the advice that all of us, regardless of age, move whenever and however we can, using whatever equipment we already have at hand.More specifically, the experts suggest starting with a focus on aerobic conditioning, which, in practical terms, means walking, if at all possible, but not necessarily formal walks. Instead, Aronson says, try to build movement into ostensibly sedentary parts of your day.“During a phone call,” she says, “walk around the room or up and down a hallway” (assuming you are not using a landline). When you watch television, get up during each commercial break and stroll from room to room. Or if you have access to a stairwell, she says, climb a flight or two of steps, which provides a brief but effective aerobic workout and some leg strengthening. Wear a mask and gloves if the stairs are public, of course, and hold tight to the banister.Ideally, older people should aim to stroll from room to room or up and down a corridor at least three times a day, Aronson says. “It may be only two or three minutes of activity at a time, but it all counts and adds up.”Look, too, for opportunities for simple, low-tech muscle workouts, the experts all say. Even skimpy, intermittent resistance training can help people avoid shedding muscle mass and strength during this lockdown.Consider the wall squat, for instance, says Dr. James Gladstone, the chief of sports medicine at Mount Sinai Health Center in New York City. This exercise requires little expertise or equipment, apart from a wall, but robustly improves leg strength. Simply stand upright a foot or so from a wall, legs shoulder distance apart. Press your back against the wall and slide down until your thighs are almost parallel with the ground. (Stop earlier if your knees hurt.) Hold this simulated sit as long as you can. “If that means five seconds, fine,” Gladstone says. Slide back up the wall, rest a few seconds, and slide down to sit again.For upper-body strengthening, raid the pantry, suggests Jennifer Copeland, a professor and director of the Active Healthy Aging lab at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada. Cans of soup or fluid-filled water bottles provide sufficient resistance for arm curls, she says. Grip those objects with your arms by your side, palms forward, and slowly bend your elbows to curl the can or bottle upward. Lower and repeat.To strengthen shoulders, she says, partially fill an empty gallon milk jug with water, hold it with both hands in front of you, arms straight, and slowly raise it to about face height. Lower gently and repeat. You can do this exercise seated.Similarly, to improve overall arm strength, reseat yourself a few times, she says. In other words, when you start to get up from a chair, purposely sit back down and partially rise several additional times, using your arms for support and leverage.And any time you visit the kitchen, slip in a few countertop pushups, suggests K. Aleisha Fetters, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and author of the new book “Fitness Hacks for Over 50.” Position yourself a few feet away from the counter and lean toward it, hinging from the ankles, back straight. Grasp the edge with straight arms and bend and straighten your elbows. Complete as many modified pushups as you can, she says, coinciding, perhaps with the length of time needed to warm your soup or coffee in the microwave. The idea, she says, is to “make fitness mesh seamlessly into your regular 24 hours.”","In younger people, such physiological weakening typically reverses as soon as they start moving and exercising normally again.
But in older people, the effects can linger and accelerate the onset of frailty.Some experts have begun to worry that this scenario is playing out among older people during the coronavirus stay-at-home orders.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , while interacting with CMs on Monday, is learnt to have suggested that states should explore the possibility of attracting investments in view of the likelihood of many companies exiting from Chinese cities in the wake of the Covid-19 virus emerging from Wuhan.The PM suggested that states should be ready for such investments as India, with abundant manpower skill and an improved infrastructure, has the potential to become an alternative destination.“As you all know, several industries will be exploring options beyond China after the coronavirus crisis.

The theory was that many were dying because their immune systems went into overdrive, creating a fatal storm that attacked their lungs.But now, preliminary results on treatments with one of these drugs, sarilumab, marketed as Kevzara and made by Regeneron and Sanofi, indicate that it does not help patients who are hospitalized but not using ventilators.The rush to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis drugs began with a tiny study in China in February. It involved just 21 patients, all of whom were hospitalized with COVID-19. All of the patients received a drug made by Roche, tocilizumab, that is very similar to sarilumab. The doctors reported that the patients’ fevers disappeared within days and, the doctors wrote, that “all other symptoms improved remarkably.” They ended on an optimistic note, writing, “Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients with COVID-19.”Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer of Regeneron, said the company had rushed to start a clinical trial of its drug in coronavirus patients. But he was not optimistic. Drugs like sarilumab and tocilizumab were specifically designed for arthritis, not COVID, he noted.“Repurposing existing drugs has not had a history of success in the pharmaceutical industry,” he said.But, with doctors around the world dosing ill patients with the arthritis drugs, Regeneron and Sanofi decided it was urgent to get reliable data.Their clinical trial randomly assigned 457 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to receive either 400 milligrams or 200 mg of sarilumab, or a placebo. The patients fell into two groups — “severe,” meaning they required oxygen but did not need a ventilator or so-called high flow oxygen, and “critical,” those who needed a ventilator, high flow oxygen or were in intensive care.Although the drug reduced c-reactive protein, which rises in severe inflammation, it did not help the severely ill patients, the companies reported Monday. Many of those patients recovered on their own. Eighty percent were discharged from the hospital, whether or not they were given the drug. Ten percent remained hospitalized, and 10% died.The results for the critically ill patients are not conclusive, but there is a hint that such patients may be helped, so the study will continue with only critically ill patients. More than 600 have been enrolled. Results are expected in early June.To date, even small controlled studies of 25, 30 or 50 patients are misleading, Yancopoulos said. What is needed are rigorous studies with sufficient numbers of patients to get reliable results.The companies are also conducting a second controlled trial of the arthritis drug in 400 critically ill patients outside the United States. Preliminary results will be available in the third quarter, the companies say.Regeneron has also designed a monoclonal antibody drug that is targeted specifically to the coronavirus, in the same way it designed the only drug that has worked against Ebola. Clinical trials of the drug will start in June.","Doctors around the world, trying to save seriously ill coronavirus patients, have been dosing them with rheumatoid arthritis drugs that can squelch immune responses.

NEW DELHI: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday scientifically validated what have been visible on the ground in river Ganga during the lockdown period. India’s national river has, indeed, become cleaner — clean enough to support aquatic life and allow you to take a dip without facing health risk.Though the river water still cannot be used for drinking purposes unless it’s chemically treated, the visible difference is, at least, in sync with what the CPCB found through its analysis of pollution loads in Ganga during pre-lockdown (March 15-21) and lockdown (March 22-April 15) periods.The country’s national pollution watchdog in its report says the “nationwide lockdown has resulted in overall improvement in water quality of river Ganga especially with regard to increased Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and reduced nitrate concentration” - it means the water quality of entire river stretch from Uttarakhand to West Bengal has attained the bathing standard and become organically rich enough to support aquatic life.The report also shows that the water quality of the river stretch in Uttar Pradesh has seen higher improvement compared to what its stretch in West Bengal witnessed. Though the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) level - a key indicator of organic pollution - is still much higher in many stretches in UP (specifically near Dhodhi Ghat in Kanpur) than its level in West Bengal, the former has seen higher improvement during lockdown period compared to its pre-lockdown period levels.Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB told TOI that it can be attributed to shutting down of industries, rains and discharge of water from Madhya Ganga Barrage in Bijnore, UP.“Uttar Pradesh has more industries than West Bengal. So, shutting down of industries mean no discharge of industrial effluent into the river in the state. Though both the states continue to get domestic discharge, additional water from Bijnore helped the river stretch in UP to get cleaned to an extent naturally,” said Gargava.He noted that the “reduced activities at Ghats” has also contributed to better water quality during the lockdown period.Water quality in upper reaches of the river in Uttarakhand (till Haridwar-Rishikesh) is comparatively much cleaner than the rest of the river stretch in four states - UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.The CPCB analysed pre-lockdown and lockdown periods data from 36 real time water quality monitoring stations along the river Ganga and its tributaries.The pollution watchdog has analysed concentration level for Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Nitrate (NO3-) and Ammoniacal Nitrogen (NH3-N) at those monitoring stations.The water bodies having BOD more than 3 mg/l are considered as polluted. More than 3 mg/l of BOD doesn’t meet the desired water quality, but it doesn’t affect DO level in water bodies. If BOD exceeds 6mg/l in water body, the DO is reduced below desired levels. The low DO level adversely affects aquatic life.The CPCB’s report, however, doesn’t talkabout drinking quality of water as it hasn’t measured the coilform level at this juncture. The coliform, a bacteria, is considered a water quality indicator as it can be associated with the sources of pathogens.For the BOD level, the report in its conclusion says, “Reduction in BOD concentration has been less significant owing to continual discharge of untreated or inadequately treated sewage. Marginal reduction can be seen only in fourth week (April 12-15 period). Further, there is gradual increase in BOD levels towards downstream stretches of the river, with the maximum values in West Bengal stretch.”Besides the river Ganga, the CPCB also analysed pollutant levels of its tributaries and found that the water quality trends of tributaries is “similar to the trends observed in river Ganga” during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods.At present, domestic wastewater from 97 towns and industrial effluent are main sources of water pollution in the river Ganga, with estimated quantity of 3500 MLD (Million Litres per Day) of sewage, out of which 1100 MLD is treated and remaining 2400 MLD gets discharged untreated.Industrial effluent is, however, estimated to be about 300 MLD, which is about 9% of total wastewater being discharged into the river every day.The CPCB has also analysed the impact of lockdown on major drains by examining data of pre-lockdown and lockdown period and found that “the improvement was less significant”.There are nine real-time water quality monitoring stations (RTWQMS) on various drains/nallahs namely Jagajeetpur STP drain (Uttarakhand), Mawaiya Naalah (UP), Kurzi Nallah (Bihar), Rjapul Nallah (Bihar), Mandiri Nallah (Bihar), Antaghat Nallah (Bihar), Nallah near Sirampur (West Bengal), Ballykhal Nallah (West Bengal) and Chitpur Nallah (West Bengal).These drains receive storm water flow and domestic & industrial effluent from towns, villages and industries situated along their course before joining Ganga directly or through one of the tributaries.“With respect to water quality of Drains discharging in River Ganga, the improvement was less significant. The DO concentration remained unchanged or slightly inferior to pre-lockdown period, with exception of high concentration at a few locations owing to favourable localised conditions. No significant variation was observed with respect to BOD & COD concentration, which remained mostly unaffected or slightly reduced than before,” said the CPCB in its report.It said the concentration of nitrate was reduced and ammoniacal nitrogen increased at most locations.“Overall, impact of lockdown on water quality of drains was not much apparent due to undeterred flow of wastewater throughout the lockdown period,” said the pollution watchdog.","Download The Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribe Start Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

Andhra dials Odisha, TN over road sealing

It is one thing to put up temporary barricades at state borders to stop people from crossing over amid the coronavirus pandemic. It becomes a completely different story when states take a leaf from US President Donald Trump’s playbook and try to seal themselves off from their neighbours by building walls and digging trenches.Officials in Tamil Nadu’s border district of Vellore surprised everyone recently by building two concrete walls overnight on roads near the Andhra border. Each wall stood three feet in width and five feet in height. Not only did this hinder traffic to Vellore, famous for its super-speciality medical services, it also blocked the movement of at least 10,000 litres of milk to AP. After the walls came up, dairy farmers in Vellore were forced to take a circuitous route.Meanwhile, Odisha had dug up some border roads after Srikakulam district in AP started reporting Covid-19 cases recently. The digging went largely unnoticed until Monday when a pregnant tribal woman had to be carried on a bamboo shaft across the trench to reach a hospital. A video of Savara Vanisri of Althi village being carried went viral on social media.Further to the north, NCR’s vision of seamless travel and movement of people also seems to be unravelling with the pandemic. Last week, both Noida and Ghaziabad decided to seal their borders with Delhi. On Sunday, Noida went a step further, saying that it would not issue travel passes to medical staff not associated with Covid duty. On Monday, it partially relented and announced a tie-up with cab aggregator Uber for non-emergency medical transport. Faridabad in Haryana on Monday has announced “tightening” of its border with Delhi; even government employees who work in Delhi but live in the NCR city have been told to make living arrangements in the capital within the 72 hours.There are moves afoot to seal other state borders as well. Goa CM Pramod Sawant on Monday said he has recommended to PM Modi that its borders with Maharashtra and Karnataka stay shut even after May 3. Back in Andhra, officials were quick to object to the sealing drive, calling up their counterparts in TN and Odisha on Monday and telling them not to put up walls and dig up highways as these could lead to a crisis during a medical emergency.In Video: Lockdown: Tamil Nadu builds walls at Andhra border to stop movement","Representative imageAndhra dials Odisha, TN over road sealing(With additional reporting by Shalabh, Snehil Sinha and Manu Aiyappa)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribe Start Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/coronavirus-antibody-tests-can-you-trust-the-results/articleshow/75387833.cms,Coronavirus antibody tests: Can you trust the results?,"The researchers worked around the clock, in shifts of three to five hours, hoping to stave off weariness and keep their minds sharp for the delicate task.They set up lines of laboratory volunteers: medical residents, postdoctoral students, even experienced veterans of science, each handling a specific task. They checked and rechecked their data, as if the world were depending on it. Because in some ways, it is.For the past few weeks, more than 50 scientists have been working diligently to do something that the Food and Drug Administration mostly has not: Verifying that 14 coronavirus antibody tests now on the market actually deliver accurate results.These tests are crucial to reopening the economy, but public health experts have raised urgent concerns about their quality. The new research, completed just days ago and posted online Friday, confirmed some of those fears: Of the 14 tests, only three delivered consistently reliable results. Even the best had some flaws.The research has not been peer-reviewed and is subject to revision. But the results are already raising difficult questions about the course of the epidemic.Surveys of residents in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York this week found that substantial percentages tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. In New York City, the figure was said to be as high as 21 percent. Elsewhere, it was closer to 3 percent.The idea that many residents in some parts of the country have already been exposed to the virus has wide implications. At the least, the finding could greatly complicate plans to reopen the economy.Already Americans are scrambling to take antibody tests to see if they might escape lockdowns. Public health experts are wondering if those with positive results might be allowed to return to work.But these tactics mean nothing if the test results can’t be trusted.In the new research, researchers found that only one of the tests never delivered a so-called false positive — that is, it never mistakenly signaled antibodies in people who did not have them.Two other tests did not deliver false-positive results 99 percent of the time.But the converse was not true. Even these three tests detected antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time, at best.The false-positive metric is particularly important. The result may lead people to believe themselves immune to the virus when they are not, and to put themselves in danger by abandoning social distancing and other protective measures.It is also the result on which scientists are most divided.“There are multiple tests that look reasonable and promising,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the project’s leaders. “That’s some reason for optimism.”Dr. Marson is also an investigator in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which partly funded the study.Other scientists were less sanguine than Dr. Marson. Four of the tests produced false-positive rates ranging from 11 percent to 16 percent; many of the rest hovered around 5 percent.“Those numbers are just unacceptable,” said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “The tone of the paper is, ‘Look how good the tests are.’ But I look at these data, and I don’t really see that.”The proportion of people in the United States who have been exposed to the coronavirus is likely to be 5 percent or less, Dr. Hensley said. “If your kit has a 3 percent false-positive, how do you interpret that? It’s basically impossible,” he said. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”Dr. Hensley said the study nonetheless was well designed and the results pressing, given the sudden proliferation of antibody tests on the market and the push to use them to lift lockdowns.“I think this is exactly the kind of study that we need right now,” he said.Dr. Marson and his colleagues said they were drawn to the study for that very reason.As universities in the Bay Area shut down all research not related to the coronavirus, some researchers began focusing on ways to improve diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.Dr. Marson and his collaborator, Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the University of California, Berkeley, anticipated that antibody tests would also face questions about quality.In mid-March, Dr. Hsu heard that a friend, a venture capitalist who owns a network of 1,000 community clinics in the New York area, had ordered thousands of rapid antibody tests. Investors and entrepreneurs seemed to be distributing them around San Francisco, too.“I realized, ‘Gosh this is really the Wild West,’” Dr. Hsu said. “We needed to figure out which of these would really work.”The duo recruited Dr. Jeffrey Whitman and Dr. Caryn Bern, who last year published an analysis of antibody tests for Chagas disease. Other graduate students and postdoctoral fellows volunteered to help perform the evaluations.The team began with a modified version of the method Dr. Whitman had devised to validate Chagas tests. The researchers created a biosafety-certified space, obtained the needed approvals and procured hundreds of blood samples from two Bay Area hospitals.They also purchased tests from Chinese manufacturers, clearing customs regulations and sometimes accepting Uber deliveries in the middle of the night.In all, the investigators analyzed 10 rapid tests that deliver a yes-no signal for antibodies, and two tests using a lab technique known as Elisa that indicate the amount of antibodies present and are generally considered to be more reliable.Suited up in protective gear, the team worked in shifts of three to five hours in a sort of socially distanced factory line.One researcher spotted the test with a blood sample, and another added the necessary chemical solutions; then two independent readers looked at the test, and a last person recorded the results. Still other team members analyzed the results, sometimes working through the night.In the early hours of recent mornings, they handed the baton to Dr. Tyler Miller and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were conducting a slightly different analysis of three tests, including one evaluated in San Francisco.The Bay Area team finished evaluating 12 tests in record time, less than a month. By comparison, the Chagas project required a team of three people working for more than a year just to compare four tests.Having a study design already in hand helped speed the work, but there was one key difference. Decades of data have shown that Chagas disease elicits lifelong immunity. For this study, the team had no idea how quickly SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might turn up in the blood, or at what levels.New tests also usually compete with an established gold standard. Lacking such a standard, the team instead compared all the tests in a “head-to-head bake-off to see who’s the winner,” Dr. Hsu said.Each test was evaluated with the same set of blood samples: from 80 people known to be infected with the coronavirus, at different points after infection; 108 samples donated before the pandemic; and 52 samples from people who were positive for other viral infections but had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.Tests made by Sure Biotech and Wondfo Biotech, along with an in-house Elisa test, produced the fewest false positives.A test made by Bioperfectus detected antibodies in 100 percent of the infected samples, but only after three weeks of infection. None of the tests did better than 80 percent until that time period, which was longer than expected, Dr. Hsu said.The lesson is that the tests are less likely to produce false negatives the longer ago the initial infection occurred, he said.The tests were particularly variable when looking for a transient antibody that comes up soon after infection, called IgM, and more consistent in identifying a subsequent antibody, called IgG, that may signal longer-term immunity.“You can see that antibody levels rise at different points for every patient,” Dr. Hsu said. The tests performed best when the researchers assessed both types of antibodies together. None of the tests could say whether the presence of these antibodies means a person is protected from reinfection, however.The results overall are promising, Dr. Marson added. “There are multiple tests that have specificities greater than 95 percent.”Rapid antibody tests are generally used to get a simple yes-no result, but the team assigned the positive results — which appear as bands on a test strip — a score from zero to six. They trained readers to interpret those results, and found their decisions often agreed and were supported by the more quantitative Elisa tests.“If you train the readers well, they can start to be reliable,” Dr. Marson said of rapid tests. “That is critical to understand if these tests could ever be deployed.”The team at Mass General set a higher bar for specificity; they considered a score of one for the intensity of a band to be a negative result, rather than a score of zero.Perhaps because they eliminated the fainter bands — the ones most likely to be erroneous — their estimate of specificity for BioMedomics, the one test that was evaluated by both teams, was more than 99 percent, compared with the San Francisco team’s estimate of 87 percent.Other experts were skeptical of the scoring approach, however. “That’s not really a method that would give you a real quantitation,” said Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.Dr. Krammer has developed a two-step Elisa test that he said has 100 percent specificity and delivers a measure of the quantity of IgM and IgG antibodies a person has. Scoring a rapid test’s bands might offer some data for a scientific study, he said, “but I would not make any decisions based on that.”Dr. Krammer said false positives are less of an issue for assessing how widely the virus has spread in the population. If a test has a known false-positive rate, scientists can factor that into their calculations, he said.But false positives become dangerous when making policy and personal decisions about who can go back to work. “You don’t want anybody back to work who has a false positive — that’s the last thing you want to do,” Dr. Krammer said.Scanwell Health, a Los Angeles-based start-up, has ordered millions of test kits from Innovita, a Chinese manufacturer, and has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market the tests for at-home use.In the new study, the Innovita test detected antibodies in 83 percent of infected people and yielded a false-positive rate of 4 percent.Dr. Jack Jeng, chief medical officer of Scanwell Health, said the study looked at an earlier version of Innovita’s test and not the “newer, improved version” his company had ordered. “It will be interesting to see how it performs,” he said.Dr. Marson and his colleagues have acquired tests from nearly 100 manufacturers, and plan to continue comparing them. The scientists also hope to expand their sample set to include people who were mildly ill or did not feel ill at all, and to stratify their data by age and the presence of chronic conditions.“This is just the beginning,” Dr. Marson said. “Our goal would be to keep going till we feel there’s adequate supply in the market.”","At the least, the finding could greatly complicate plans to reopen the economy.Already Americans are scrambling to take antibody tests to see if they might escape lockdowns.

If you have received a WhatsApp Forward message saying that the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India has permitted homeopaths to treat novel coronavirus , then be warned. The message is completely fake and holds no ground.This fake message was busted through a fact check done by the official Twitter account of MyGovIndia. “A WhatsApp message circulating, claiming @moayush has permitted Homeopaths to treat the COVID-19 is FAKE! Stay Informed, Stay Safe!” read the tweet.In the post, it has also shared an image which clarifies that the said ministry has only announced short-term research projects for evaluating the impact of AYUSH medicines in managing COVID-19. For those unaware, AYUSH stands for Ayurvedic, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. All five comprise the indigenous medicine system of India.With the number of coronavirus cases in India has crossed the mark of 29,000 in the country, fear and panic around the outbreak continues. In these challenging times, it becomes more vital to check the spread of rumours and misinformation via social media platforms. To help curb the spread of these messages, WhatsApp has set a limit on forwarding messages. As per an announcement made earlier this month, a WhatsApp user will not be able to forward certain messages to more than one chat at a time on the app. The new restriction notably is for those WhatsApp messages that have been forwarded many times. All such messages are labelled with double arrows and must be taken as an indication that they did not originate from close contacts.Another feature that WhatsApp is reportedly working on to stop misinformation from spreading is the option to search a message on Google to check its authenticity. This feature has been spotted on the beta version of the Android app of WhatsApp version 2.20.94","A WhatsApp message circulating claiming @moayush has permitted Homeopaths to treat the COVID-19 is FAKE!

MUMBAI: The novel coronavirus , first reported in China in December 2019, has mutated into 10 different types and one of them — A2a — has nearly replaced all the others to become dominant across geographical regions, says a global study by an Indian institute.The study, by Nidhan Biswas and Partha Majumder from the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in Kalyani, West Bengal, will soon be published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research , a peer-reviewed medical journal published by the Indian Council for Medical Research ( ICMR ).The novel coronavirus with the A2a mutation is highly efficient in entering human lung cells in larger numbers. The previous SARS-CoV that killed 800 and infected 8,000 people 10 years ago was also adept in entering the lungs, but not as much as A2a. It is efficient in transmission and resultantly, Covid-19 became highly prevalent across all regions, wrote the authors. The study is crucial as it provides vaccine manufacturers with a specific target.The 10 types have evolved from the ancestral type ‘O’ over four months. A2a started overtaking other types across the world by March-end. “It has became the dominant type of SARS-CoV2,” said Majumder.The NIBG researchers used the RNA sequence data shared by Covid-19 researchers from across the world in a public database, GISAID. The team used RNA sequences of 3,600 coronaviruses collected from 55 countries from December 2019 to April 6, 2020.The first observation was that the coronavirus has evolved into newer types during its spread within China and the rest of the world. “The coronavirus can be classified into many types --- O, A2, A2a, A3, B, B1, and so on. Currently, there are 11 types, including type O which is the ‘ancestral type’ that originated in Wuhan,” said Majumder, distinguished professor and founding director of the institute.“To live, a virus must propagate by infecting other animals. A mutation usually disables the virus from transmitting itself,” said Majumder. However, some mutations enable the virus to transmit more efficiently and infect more persons. “Such mutant viruses increase the frequency (of transmission) and sometimes completely replace the original type of the virus. The SARS-CoV2 is doing just that,” he added.The coronavirus infection, or Covid , begins in the patient’s throat, then enters his lungs and multiplies, causing breathing difficulties. The scientists said the A2a mutation altered a component of the spike protein (the major protein on the surface) of the coronavirus, allowing it to bind more easily with the surface protein of the lung cell, said Majumder. Covid-19 has emerged as a pandemic because of the A2a type’s ability to transmit easily.Even though the sample of RNA sequences used from infected persons in India was very small (35), the study showed that A2a accounted for 47.5% of the samples. Interestingly, more persons with type A2a have no known travel history to countries outside India. For any conclusions on whether type A2a is dominant in India, more samples of RNA sequences are required, said the researchers.The study is important for the fight against Covid-19 --- to develop vaccines and also to determine the presence of co-existence of type A2a with other types in some regions. Studies are required to find out whether the co-existence is because of the ethnic composition of these regions or it’s because of their travel patterns. Researchers at the institute are trying to answer some of these questions.","Representative imageMore on Covid-19Download The Times of India News App for Latest City NewsSubscribe Start Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

NEW DELHI: The government and central bank are trying to cushion an economy that was slowing even before the coronavirus outbreak.Here’s a guide to the measures announced so far:A series of steps announced this year aim to encourage banks to lend.On February 6, it was announced that banks don’t need to set aside cash reserves for loans given to small businesses between January 31 to July 31, or for credit to help consumers buy a car or home.Policy lending rate -- the repurchase rate -- was cut by 75 basis points (bps) in a single move this year. However, the effective deposit rate has been slashed by 115 bps to discourage lenders from playing safe and parking the cash with the RBI.Cash Reserve Ratio reduced to 3% from 4%Liquidity Coverage Ratio lowered to 80% from 100% (will be restored to 90% by October 1 and 100% by April 1, 2021)Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das has stopped the clock on loan repayments amid an unprecedented three-week lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.All lenders can freeze repayments for three months on term loans outstanding March 1.Lenders allowed to suspend interest payments on working capital facilities for three months; accumulated interest can be paid later and the loans won’t be in default.The steps add to previous measures which allow a one-off restructuring of loans to small businesses that were in default as of January 1.Loans to commercial property projects that are delayed for reasons beyond the control of the developer are allowed to be treated as standard for another year.Implementation of stricter regulations have been delayed.Rules requiring banks to fund their activities through stable sources has been deferred to October 1 from April 1.Completion of capital conservation buffer pushed to September 30 from March 31.Lenders allowed an additional 90 days to reach a resolution plan on large accounts in default.These include support for corporate borrowers as well as rural industry.TLTRO 1.0: Rs 1 lakh crore of targeted long term funds from the central bank to banks for investing only in corporate bonds, aimed at easing cash crunch at firms (on April 15, RBI announced new rule capping the exposure of any bank to a single entity at 10% of TLTRO funds invested).TLTRO 2.0: Initial Rs 50,000 crore targeted at shadow lenders, with at least half going to lower rated firms (announced on April 17).Special refinance to umbrella organisations -- Rs 50,000 crore to go to pan-India financiers like Sidbi, Nabard, NHB that affordably fund the rural sector and agriculture.Credit line for mutual funds -- Rs 50,000 crore credit facility running April 27 to May 11, or until the funds are utilized, whichever is earlier.Banks ordered to maintain higher provision of 10% on all frozen loans spread over the January-March and April-June quarters, which can be adjusted later against actual slippages.Banks can’t pay dividends for the year ended March 31 to conserve capital. Decision will be reviews on the basis of their financial position on September 30.The RBI has been injecting additional liquidity in the banking system to keep down bond yields.At its February policy review, the RBI said it will provide 1 trillion rupees of one- and three-year cash at the policy rate via long-term repo operations to help monetary transmission.The RBI ramped up these measures in March and April.Two variable rate repo operations of Rs 50,000 crore to fine-tune liquidity at the financial year end.Enhanced a temporary liquidity tap for primary bond underwriters to Rs 10,000 crore from Rs 2,800 crore.Rs 1 lakh crore of LTROsOpen market purchase of government bonds worth Rs 10,000 crore on March 20; another total Rs 30,000 crore of OMO purchases March 24 and March 26.Rs 1 lakh crore via 16-day variable rate reposIndia opened up a wide swath of its sovereign bond market to overseas investors, taking its biggest step yet to secure access to global indexes as the government embarks on a record borrowing plan.The government announced a fiscal first-half borrowing number that’s lower than what traders expected, as it seeks to check any rise in yields amid a global risk aversion that’s sparked outflows from emerging markets.RBI pledged to inject dollars through dollar-rupee swaps.Two $2 billion swap lines each for March 16 and March 23 provided $2.7 billionTrading in sovereign debt and the rupee is being held from 10 am to 2 pm Mumbai time starting April 7 through April 30. These markets normally worked from 9 am to 5 pm.Allows companies additional 45 days for declaring their quarterly and annual results; extends the date for submission of corporate governance report by a month; company boards exempted from provision of maximum time gap between two meetings.Trading margin in stocks increased, market-wide position reduced to ease volatility in stocks.Compliance requirements relaxed for ReITs, InVITS, extends deadline for risk management rules for liquid mutual funds; timeline for filing debenture and preference share issues extended.Raised the threshold of defaults needed to trigger insolvency proceedings to Rs 1 crore from Rs 1 lakh.Capital, debt market services exempt from lockdownAllows top 100 listed companies another month to comply with the requirements of holding annual general meeting.Shareholders allowed 45 more days to disclose their consolidated shareholding in companies for the financial year ending March 31.Relaxed the recognition of default by local credit rating companies if a delay in payment of interest or principal is due; allows foreign portfolio investors relaxation in document processing.Eased rules to fast-track rights issues, and also extended the validity of its observations on public issues by six months from the date of expiry to help companies raise funds amid the coronavirus pandemic.Lowers by 50% broker turnover and filing fees on offer documents for public issues, rights issues and share buybacksThe time period for realisation and repatriation of export proceeds for shipments before July 31 extended to 15 months to provide greater flexibility to exporters in negotiating future export contracts with buyers abroad.State administrations have been permitted to borrow as much as half their annual target for the year starting April 1 whenever they choose. In a typical year, strict rules would govern the timetable, which would include cash transfers from the federal government that are now under threat as the lockdown erodes revenue.RBI decided to increase the Ways and Means limit -- short term funding cap -- by 60% for all states to enable them to “tide over the situation.""

Dhoni last played in the World Cup 2019 semifinal against New Zealand and since then has been on a sabbatical.It was believed that Dhoni's performance in the IPL would decide if he will be a part of India's World T20 squad. But cricketer-turned-commentator Aakash Chopra begs to differ. The former India opener termed it a ""misconception"" people had.""It's a huge misconception that Dhoni's comeback to the Indian team was dependent on his performance in the IPL,"" Chopra said. ""If that is how we will view Dhoni as a player and his career and what he has achieved as a player, then I think we are just knocking at the wrong door, because it's not right.""Chopra feels that if Dhoni wants to play for the Indian team again and if the team management also wants the same, it will happen.""See, if the team wants him to play, all that will happen. But if the IPL doesn't take place this year, the T20 World Cup doesn't happen this year, (then), of course, he will be a year older; and with him out of the cricket for more than 18 months, you can assume that you might not see him play again for India,"" Chopra pointed.The former India batsman, however, said that looking at the present scenario, organising the T20 World Cup looks ""difficult"" in October-November, which in turn can open a window for the 13th edition of the IPL.Chopra also believed that if there is a chance to conduct the IPL ""behind closed doors"", it must be taken.""It's still a long shot because we don't know how the world is going to operate. This COVID-19 pandemic is a developing story. For a tournament like the IPL, you have to ensure players' safety. It's being contemplated to have the IPL behind closed doors and I think it's better to have the tournament with empty stands rather than not having the tournament at all.""To be honest, the T20 World Cup looks very, very difficult because Australia has already put a travel ban till September. The T20 World Cup is slated to be played in October. So October-November might just turn out to be the window to open up suddenly because moving the entire world to one place and then playing the tournament is a lot tougher than playing, say the IPL, in one country where most of the players are Indians and only a handful of players have to fly in.""From a commentator and a cricket lover's point of view, I would want the IPL to happen,"" he added.","""It's a huge misconception that Dhoni's comeback to the Indian team was dependent on his performance in the IPL,"" Chopra said.

And although doctors and researchers are making progress on different ways to treat the illness, much remains uncertain.Many common symptoms continue to be identified, and families staying at home can take steps now to prepare in case someone falls ill, to best monitor one’s health and to alleviate symptoms. Many people who get coronavirus feel lousy, but they get better in a few weeks.Make sure, to start, that you have at least a 30-day supply of prescription medications if you take them, and check that you have a well-stocked first-aid kit, too.To get a sense of what else you should — and should not — have in your medicine cabinet at this time, we talked to doctors and pharmacists across the country. Here is the medicine and equipment they recommend.Even before you head to the pharmacy, make sure your medications and equipment can be stored safely.“A medicine cabinet in a bathroom that gets steamy from a bath or shower isn’t an ideal place,” said Dr. Ilisa Bernstein, the senior vice president of pharmacy practice and government affairs at the American Pharmacists Association. “The humidity could impact the ingredients over time.”A hallway linen closet is better, she said. That doesn’t mean you need to throw out old medications, but it’s good to know for the future. Wherever you keep them, make sure the bottles are away from children.Fever is one of the most prominent symptoms of the coronavirus.If you have a thermometer in your house already, make sure you have extra batteries. If you have two, check your temperature on both: They are not infallible. Between uses, disinfect the thermometer with alcohol or peroxide.If you are buying a thermometer, oral readers are the best, said Dr. Stacey Curtis, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. An ear thermometer needs to be placed properly for accuracy, and a forehead thermometer might not get a good reading if the patient is sweating, she said.But some pharmacies are out of stock, and some online options are not verified or will take a long time to be delivered. If you cannot get a thermometer quickly, do not panic.Although it can be comforting to know the precise number, it will be obvious if you have a fever, said Dr. Stephen Eckel, a clinical associate professor at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy. You will be cold and shivery, and will often sweat or be flushed. If you are exceptionally weak, dizzy or hallucinating, call your doctor. Consult with them before you go to the hospital.Some patients develop a pneumonia that can cause oxygen levels to drop before they experience severe symptoms. A pulse oximeter is a hand-held, clip-like device that measures the oxygen level of your bloodstream. Some clip onto fingertips or earlobes. Normal readings usually range from 95% to 100%. A blood-oxygen level under 90 is considered low.There have been shortages of pulse oximeters, too. If you can’t find one right away, you can probably find one that can be delivered in a few weeks or a month.If you get sick and don’t have a home pulse oximeter, don’t panic. Although it can be comforting to put a number to a symptom, it is not always necessary, said Dr. Albert Rizzo, the chief medical officer of the American Lung Association.“I hate to have my patients fixate on numbers like this,” he said. “I think it’s more important that you listen to what your body is telling you.”If you are struggling to draw a full breath, call your doctor and communicate concrete symptoms: I’m more short of breath now than I was yesterday. I can’t climb the stairs. I’m coughing more.“I’m not saying don’t buy it, but it’s not the thing I’d have at the top of my list when it’s hard to get,” Rizzo said of pulse oximeters. “If you felt short of breath enough that you want to get a pulse ox, call your doctor.”Most people do fine without them. You also can also borrow one from a friend (they are easily sanitized) or talk to your doctor about getting your oxygen levels checked at an urgent care center.Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen will reduce a fever, and can be used to treat the uncomfortable symptoms of fever: headache, aches and chills.Pharmacists caution against taking too much acetaminophen, which can cause severe liver damage. And you should be aware that many over-the-counter cough medications also contain acetaminophen. The total amount of acetaminophen taken in pain relievers and cold medications should not exceed 3,000 milligrams a day. Additionally, alcohol should not be consumed when taking acetaminophen.Patients with underlying conditions should check before taking any medication. Also, children and adults have different dosages. Be sure to read the label before giving children medication.Some doctors caution against reducing a fever at all. The immune system works better when the body’s temperature is higher, and dozens of studies have shown fever to be beneficial in fighting infections.“When you treat with fever-reducing medicines, as has been shown again and again and again, you decrease the body’s ability to make antibodies,” said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.Even if it is uncomfortable, it might be best to sweat this one out.There has been controversy about whether ibuprofen is safe to take for coronavirus. The World Health Organization said it was not aware of any research showing that the over-the-counter drug should not be taken by infected patients.There are other things that might alleviate some symptoms. Throat lozenges will soothe an aching throat, which can come from coughing. Be sure children do not choke on them. If you are worried, honey works, too (although it is not recommended for children younger than 2).The coronavirus can lead to nausea or diarrhea. Although it can be uncomfortable, it might be best to let whatever gastrointestinal distress happen, because it is a way your body gets rid of infection.“We are not recommending anyone take anything to stop the diarrhea,” Curtis said. “We want them to go ahead and have diarrhea.”But diarrhea can cause dehydration, so she recommends getting an electrolyte-replenisher like Pedialyte to replace minerals. Regular sports drinks are sugary and have less of an impact.Cold medicines are largely ineffective, but antihistamines can help if you have seasonal allergies.The most important thing, if you are feeling sick, is to communicate with a doctor or pharmacist. Although it may take time to wait in the line, a call to a pharmacist is free. He or she can help you talk through your concerns, and offer advice.","“The humidity could impact the ingredients over time.”A hallway linen closet is better, she said.
